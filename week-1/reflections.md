## 1.1 Think About Time
Time management is the process of setting up a personal schedule that is the most offers the most efficiency in regards to work to each person. This is a subjective process and can vary greatly from person to person. The idea of a time box is where one sets up slots of time to commit to working or studying, as well as a brief break in between to clear ones head or something of that nature. In regards to using a time box, I think in phase 0, the best way would be to slightly modify it. Instead of setting time aside to work and break, one could actually decide to break in between every challenge. As well as set a limit to how many challenges they will do per day. This would allow a person to focus on one challenge till it is finished, break, and then start the next challenge with a clear head. I've used this method during my time working at Lexus and I believe it was efficient for me. I plan on applying this to phase 0 as well. With this method I feel as if I am more concentrated on the task at hand, achieving that "flow" or "in the zone" state.Although challenge limits may change from day to day depending if there are other personal things that need to be done throughout the day, I will try to maintain the process of breaking after every challenge, and going into the next one with a clear head. Again, this is a highly subjective experience and may be different for each person.
## 1.2 The Command Line
 A shell is a command line interface, also known as a “CLI” which allows the user to view processes, navigate, and make changes to an operating system through commands via keyboard input. Bash is one of the various types of shell programs used to navigate the operating system and make changes.



            The most challenging part of this material was the video. I couldn’t seem to initially grasp a few of the concepts discussed in the videos, so I did some of my own research to further understand the concepts and commands. Ultimately, everything was covered in the crash course section of the challenge.



            The crash course explained everything very well, and I was able to use all the required commands as well as the “do more” section of the crash course.



            In my opinion, the three most important commands to know are the cd, ../, and ls. The reason for this is because when navigating in bash, it seems to be easy to get lost in the multitude of directories and files. With these commands one can always deduce in which directory they are, so that they can use the appropriate commands to that directory or file. If one gets lost and then changes something that isn’t meant to be change, they can cause possible damage.



The following commands mean the following things:



pwd – stands for “print working directory” and informs the user of the directory they are currently in



ls – lists all the directories and files within the current directory



mv – moves or renames the directory or file



cd – changes into a specified directory, going down a path



../ - goes up the path into a parent directory



touch – creates a new and empty file



mkdir – makes a new directory within a directory



less – prints the content of a file in one page intervals which can be scrolled through using the spacebar



rmdir – deletes a directory from the current directory. The directory being deleted must be empty.



rm – deletes a file from a directory



help – informs the user of the operating systems stats and gives all possible commands and what they do


## 1.4 Forking and Cloning
To create a new repo, sign into github, on the top right there is a + symbol. Press on that and a drop down menu will pop up. Select the "New Repository" tab. This will bring you to a new screen. On this screen you name your repository, select whether it is public or private(whether anyone can see it or only people you allow), select a license and lastly, press create repository.

In order to fork a repo, firstly you must be signed into your account. find the repo you would like to fork, and towards the top right there is a fork button. Press the button and select to what account or repository you would like to fork it too.

To clone a repository locally to your computer you first open up the command line terminal, or command prompt in windows. Use "pwd" to see which directory you're in. If you aren't in the directory you want to be in to clone the repo into, you can either make a new directory by using "mkdir" and typing a new for the directory, or use "cd" to change into a existing directory. Once you are in the directory you want, use the command "git clone" followed by the URL of the repository you are cloning. This URL can be found on the repositories on github next to the "new file", "find file" and "HTTPS" buttons. Once you paste that next to the "git clone" command just press enter and the computer will do the rest.

The benefits of forking a repository is that you can follow the changes and processes the original user makes to the repository. If you make a new repository, you would only see your own changes.

I didn't find this challenge too complicated. The instructions and videos were very straight forward and I felt as if I was understanding everything from the first time. However if I was to choose the most challenging aspect to understand, I would have to say it was forking. I finally understood the reason behind it, it is useful to track other peoples work without having to create a new repository.
