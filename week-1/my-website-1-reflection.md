1. Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.
https://github.com/leokukhar/leokukhar.github.io

2. Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
Sign onto github. Where it says "Your repositories", on the right side of the screen, there will be a green button next to it  saying "+ New Repository". Pressing that will bring you into a new screen where you would name the repository, put an optional description, select whether it is public or private, check whether to initialize the repository with a readme, and select the lisence you want. Doing that will create a new repositroy on github. In order to clone this to your local computer you copy the URL provided on the new repository screen. Go into the command line and select the directory you want to copy the repository into. From here you type the command "git clone URL", and paste the URL that you copied from the website in place of "URL". Once thats done the repository will be cloned to your local computer.

3. Describe what open source means.
Open source means that any person is able to share or download a computer program free of charge and modify or change it however they want, possibly making it better. Depending on the liscence, certain aspects like who gets credit for a project may be a stipulation in open source projects.

4. What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I believe that open source is useful in the way that a person is able to make a prototype program, and let others fine tune it to make it better. As long as that person isn't looking to make money off of the program, it seems to be a very useful tool. Liscences should be used carefully in order to protect the person who ultimately wants to get credit for the program.

5. Assess the importance of using licenses.
Liscences are extremely important in protecting who gets credit for the original code. If receiving credit for work isn't an issue, a person can choose the MIT liscence, which is the least strict of all of the liscences available. However, if receiving credit is an issue, there are a multitude of liscences to choose from, ones with varying degrees of stipulations for each individual project. In all, liscences are important to protect the individual who originally created the program.

6. What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
The biggest concept that was solidified during the challange was the creation of new branches to modify your work in, and the pushing, pulling, and merging of new work to the online and local repositories. When I first did this I had trouble memorizing the commands needed, as well as mixing up the steps. Now I feel more confident in my abilities to do this without any help.

7. Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I did a some reading on github in regards to liscences, such as the following help article https://github.com/blog/1964-open-source-license-usage-on-github-com. It was useful in describing the importance of liscences and which ones are most often used.
