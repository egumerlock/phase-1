// Person 1 (Ryan Dempsey)

//   Release 1:

//     I've got two groups of numbers, one of odd length, the other of even length.       As a user, I need to create three different functions to do the following:

//       - add each of these groups up
//       - find the average in each of these groups
//       - determine the mid-point for each of these group



// Person 2 (Leo Kukhar)

// Release 2:

// 1. Define a method called add.
// 2. The add method should iterate over every element in the group and add it to a sum counter.
// 3. Return sum.

// 4. Define a second method called average.
// 5. Call the add method inside the newly defined average method.
// 6. Create a local variable called average and set it equal to the sum divided by the length of the group.
// 7. Return average.

// 8. Define a method called mid-point.
// 9. Call the sort method on the groups so that the numbers are sorted from least to greatest.
// 10. Using an if/else statement, if the length of the group is an odd number, return the number which is index[length/2]
// 11. Else return the average of the two middle numbers, (index[length / 2] + index[lenght / 2 + 1]) / 2
