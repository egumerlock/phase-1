1. What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return  to often? Why?
- In this challenge and others I tend to use <header>, <footer>, and section a lot. I feel that these convey a lot of meaning and will be extremely useful in CSS styling. It brings a rigid structure to the webpage which ultimately make it easier to code.
2. How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
-Using HTML, elements get laid out from the top down. This is because browsers read the HTML files from the top down.
3. What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
-I learned how how to create snippets and why they are useful in sublime. I think I will create more handy ones later on in the course when I learn more material. It is very useful, especially when you have to type out multiple rounds of the same code for different files. It is a really big time saver.
