1.How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
- You can play around with attributes and values and see the changes happen in real time. This is a huge time saver than actually changing code, commiting it, and opening it to inspect it.

2.How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
-The DOM allows you to see the parent elements in the HTML tree, which is useful if you are using relative positioning in CSS.

3.What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
-Absolute positioning takes the element out of the normal flow of the page and puts it over the elements, therefore not affecting them. Fixed positioning is almost the same as absolute positioning except it is in relation to the browser window. Static positioning makes every element appear on a new line. Relative positioning applies the position of the element relative to the parent element. I find that relative positioning seems to be the easiest to work with because the postioning is based on the parent element's positioning.

4.What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
-Margin is the white space between elements that nothing can occupy. Border is the enclosement of the element. Padding is the space between the border and the actual element.

5.What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
-I found the later the exercises in the challenges to be somewhat difficult. Me and my partner ended up playing around with the margins in order to get the correct layout although I feel as if there were definetly simpler ways to do the exercises. Overall I felt a little frustrated.
