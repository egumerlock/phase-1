What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
- The six phases of web design are information gathering, planning, design, development, testing and delivery, and maintenance.
What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
- My site's primary goal is to tell prospective employers about me and my job history. It will have a picture of me as well as an about me, job history within that about me, a blog, and contact information.
What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
- My target audience would be prospective employees, therefore the site will be strictly professional.
What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
- The primary action for a user visiting my site would be to automatically see my contact information first. After that they would look at my job history which would be a different page. I believe this would be the best way to capture the attention of prospective employers.
What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
-The link between design and user experience is constantly evolving due to constant research by UX designers. User experience is a term used to describe how a user feels when they navigate a site. It is a subjective value described by users and designers alike. Therefore a lot of design that goes into the creation of a website is based off of what instrinsically makes the user feel good about the site.
What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
- User experience design is the act of designing a website in a way that is most pleasant for the user. It takes the user's feelings and input into consideration before designing anything. It is valuable at attracticting and retaining users. Therefore a website that is more user friendly, easy to use, pleasant to look at; will beat any regular website.
Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
- I found the linking of the picture tedious because I got a little confused about the path that the picture was in.
