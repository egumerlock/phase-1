1.What does puts do?
  -Puts is like print except it adds a new line, or a line break after it prints out the content.

2.What is an integer? What is a float?
  -An integer is a whole number; it could be either negative or positive. A float is a number with decimals in it such as 10.3.

3.What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
  - When dividing with integers, it is best to remember that it will not give you a float number as a result. Therefore 12 divided by 5 will not give you 2.4. Any division with integers that results in a remainder or a a decimal place will result in the answer being rounded down to the nearest whole integer. Division with floats however will give you more exact answers with decimal places.
